# Pocket Christmas Card
Creative animated holiday greetings for family, friends, and clients! This is one of my flash animations redesigned with Adobe Animate CC and CreateJS into a responsive HTML5 template. In addition to a fun orthographic animation, this template features a customizable integrated logo, an external music file included in the download archive, an editable textblock for your greetings message, and a button with custom URL-linking to redirect the user to your website or social media profile.

The animation is centered in the window. The template is entirely responsive and the design seems accurate and crisp on all devices. Editing options make it simple to personalize the logo, music, text greetings, URL-button, and recolor objects (background, folder, trees, gifts, and toys). The use of JavaScript and style. CSS may be written with any text editor. Note that for extra editing, such as shapes or animations, Adobe Animate CC must be installed.
